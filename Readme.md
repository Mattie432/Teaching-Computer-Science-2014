#Teaching Computer Science 2014
This is a set of answers to a GCSE continuous assessment for 'computing', done to gain an understanding of what students are working on during my time assisting at a school. Due to the level of programming knowledge of pupils I have tried not to use very complex features while answering these questions with the aim of being more representative of what students might end up doing.

A description of each problem can be found on the readme accompanying each program.
